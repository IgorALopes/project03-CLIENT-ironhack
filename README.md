This is a website for game developers and for who likes to test new games. If you are a game developer you have the chance to show your game under development, and receive feedback from other users, this way you can improve it. If you enjoy testing games, feel free to test, give feedback and like the games. If you really liked you can add to your favorites and follow its development.

This project was the third and the final one made during Ironhack's Web Development bootcamp. After 9 weeks we could develop a full stack application. The API was developed using NodeJS and MongoDB. For the Client side we used ReactJS, formik, bootstrap, React Hot Toast, all based in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
